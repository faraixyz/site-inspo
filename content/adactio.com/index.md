Jeremy Keith who owns the site is someone who I greatly respect, particularly his philosphy on web development.

The design isn't anything special, but it does a good job making all the site's information reachable. It also has [sparklines](https://adactio.com/journal/5941) to show the frequency of posts and also provide a sound. I saw how charts on Apple use them when you have voiceover and I hope to have something like it some day. I wonder if [audio worklets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet) can do this?

Also, there's this cool thing he does called [<dfn>POSSE</dfn> (post on own site syndicate elsewhere)](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). Basically, you generate all of your content and social media posts on a domain you control and then make integrations to put them elsewhere. It's a lot of work, but it does keep information under your control.
