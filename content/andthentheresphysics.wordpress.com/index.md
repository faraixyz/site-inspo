Run by [astrophysicist Ken Rice](https://www.roe.ac.uk/~wkmr/), it's nothing exciting but it let's him focus on writing.

**General Layout**: Simple header, content takes up most of the space and a sidebar.

**Sidebar**: Has search, top/recent posts, recent comments, blogroll, newsletter, useless ExTwitter timeline, word cloud, archives page by month, follow ExTwitter and recent feed posts from certain authors. I'ts very cluttered, the blogroll can be shorter and the feeds should be combined to have a few. Stuff belongs to other pages.

**Interesting Content**: [Comments policy](https://andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/comments-policy/) and [moderation policy](https://andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/moderation-policy/) which seem condusive to productive discorse. Also an [about me page](https://andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/about-2/) with a brief description of how the site came about.
