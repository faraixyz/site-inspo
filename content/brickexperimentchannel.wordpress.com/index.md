Much like [...And Then There's Physics](/content/andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/index.md), it's pretty plain so he can focus on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/BrickExperimentChannel). Despite the simplicity, I like that the header shows content you'll probably want to see.

Main features: Header, side bar and main content. Sidebar is search and every post. Can get unwieldy but there isn't much.

Interesting Content: [Learning how the sausage is made](https://brickexperimentchannel.wordpress.com/videomaking/)
