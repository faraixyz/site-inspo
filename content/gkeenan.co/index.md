Finally something different with a static site generator, specifically Eleventy which [he had a fun time implementing](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/an-alarmingly-concise-and-very-hinged-summary-of-what-it-was-like-to-build-this-site-from-scratch/). The pink looks good here and I like the typewriter effect ([TT 2020](https://copypaste.wtf/TT2020/docs/)).

I like how articles have a table of contents. He also lists his [photo blog](https://glass.photo/keenan) and a [wants page](https://gkeenan.co/wants/), which I read while listening to [<cite>I Wish</cite> by Skee-Lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryDOy3AosBw). There's also a [now page](https://gkeenan.co/now/) (part of the [/now page movement](https://sive.rs/now3)) which I really should put back on my current site.
