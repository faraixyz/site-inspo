Yeah so this site is...hella basic. It's just a list of every blog post with very little besides the pagination and a menu with just an about page. Whoever made this site should be embarassed with themselves. Let's see the [about](https://conspycons.wordpress.com/about/) page and see out who it is:

> Hi, I’m [Farai](https://im.farai.xyz/)—a conspicuous consumer who try’s out many different things like food.

Mmm Farai? That's my name! And that link is my website!

Feigning suprise over, I forgot I added my food blog to my RSS feed. I should add it to my site too...
