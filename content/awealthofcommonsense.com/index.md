This is another unremarkable WordPress blog, but that does't mean I like his writing any less. Again someone who has better things to do than fuck around with a blog. It does a great job outlining his work in the header, like his [investing](https://www.ritholtzwealth.com/learn-more), [books](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/my-book/) and [speaking info.](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/contact/)

Seriously, give him a read.
