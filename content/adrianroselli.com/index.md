Adrian Roselli is a web a11y (digital accessibility) expert who does a lot of free work figuring out how to do things accessibly with very detailed posts.

The links in the header are chonky, but that's so it's usable on mobile. I also find the changing header subtitle incredibly funny.

As for the blog header, the drop down implementation makes sense instead of relyinng on a hover. I do like it has quick links to useful sections like [tables](https://adrianroselli.com/tag/tables) though I wish he had one for his useful [under-engineered components](https://adrianroselli.com/?s=under+engineered) posts.

There's also the search page that links out to a search engine if the results aren't good eonugh. It's also mentioned on the 404 page.

Given that accessibility is the thing, there's a lot of lovley outlines and link styles. The posts listing also uses grid which is cool. Each list item has a title, description and then some metadata at the bottom so thats one way of doing it.

The site also has a theme toggle as well as an [HTML sitemap](https://adrianroselli.com/site-map) as well as an [accessibility statement](https://adrianroselli.com/accessibility-statement). I think I should have an accessibility statement but I don't know what to put yet.

While the point of this exersize is to look at how websites look like behind the veil of RSS, Adrian has done invaluable work in showing how to do things accessibility, bearing in mind that you need to test with real users.
