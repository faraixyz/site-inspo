Holy shit, this is something completley different. This is the best looking site I've seen so far from Shadeed, a designer dev. I can rave on for days about all the fun little tidbits on his site, but it won't end. Sadly, I need to look at things at a higher level but [the post he wrote on the redesign](https://ishadeed.com/article/redesign-2024/#the-timeline) is helpful to see how he went about it.

The home page does a good job describing who he is, what he's done and people who've spoken positivley about him in a fun and interactive way.

The [about page](https://ishadeed.com/about/) also looks really cool with a lot of personality, particularly the coffee corner. I've always wondered whether to have an about section since the home page does it fine but I think I can do bothâ€”home page is brief and the about page goes in depth.

There is a dark mode switch though it's just a toggle.

The articles listing seems basic but it does outline everything along with tags. It even has a featured section and marks posts that are interactive.

The posts themselves have a pretty thematic header along with a two column layout featuring the table of contents and the article contents. The contents themselves can include interactive elements.

In all, I'm learning that a little personality goes a long way.
