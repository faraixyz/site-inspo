I'm not sure what's going on with the home page, it seems like he took a restaurant website theme and did little to change it.

The article page is very minimalistic with a big header and a skinny main section. The only discoverability on this site are the tags at the bottom and some URL hackingâ€”not ideal for a blog I otherwise enjoy very much. Ironically in my quest to peek behind my RSS feeds and manually examine what people work on is falling apart here as RSS is a much better way of browsing this site. I might offer to redesign it for free.
