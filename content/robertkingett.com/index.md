I thought this would be another stock WordPress site but it turns out the `wordpress` I searched for in the OPML file pointed to an RSS feed that's being redirected to his new domain at [`robertkingett.com](https://robertkingett.com/). Also, it isn't using WordPress but instead it's using [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/) which doesn't come with [the Gutenberg editor which had a lot of accessibility issues](https://www.marcozehe.de/my-thoughts-on-gutenberg-accessibility/) that would really matter to Robert who's blind.

In fact, while he still uses one of WordPress's stock themes, it's by design as he says:

> Notice how this site is made for screen reader users? Thatâ€™s by design. I also tried to make this site easy to use for magnifier users before I lost my vision.

I also like the [site map](https://robertkingett.com/map/) which lists all the content on the site. I should make one.

He also put a really nice header that makes the site really navigable.
