It's kinda cheating since Substack technically is more as a newsletter service so I'll be outlining what I like from Substack's templates.

The Substacks I subscribe to are:

* [The Africanist Perspective](https://www.africanistperspective.com/about) by Ken Opalo about Africa's political economy.
* [Apply Liberalism](https://applyliberally.substack.com/) by Matthew on liberalism and Georgism
* [Construction Physics](https://www.construction-physics.com/) by Brian Potter on construction.
* [The Discourse Lounge](https://darrellowens.substack.com/) by Darrel Owens on housing, politics and housing politics.
* [Joe's Junk Food](https://joesjunkfood.substack.com/) by Joe who reviews junk food.
* [Why Aren't I Writing](https://suwca.substack.com/) by Suw Charman-Anderson on writing and surviving as a creative.

Don't have much to say about these since the templates are good enough. There is a tabbed interface to allow for arbitrary links, but only the Africanist and Why Aren't I Writing make use of this to add relevant links to their work.
